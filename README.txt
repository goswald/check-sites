TO USE:

Edit the file "mysites.txt" and enter, one per line, a list of web addresses for sites you log into.
Save the file.
Mac and *nix users:  Set "check-sites.sh" as executable and run it.
Windows users: Double click to run "check-sites.exe" or "check-sites.ps1" if you are permitted to run PowerShell scripts.
Once the script completes, a list of files will be put in "compromised_sites.txt."

Please feel free to look at the code in my script or contact me if you have any concerns. <3
